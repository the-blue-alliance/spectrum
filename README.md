## Download

#Download with Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.thebluealliance:spectrum:0.2.0'
```

The library is hosted on both Bintray (JCenter) and Maven Central; use whichever you prefer.
```groovy
repositories {
  jcenter()
}

## Features
- `SpectrumDialog` with Builder pattern
- `SpectrumPreference` for easily adding color selection to your app's preferences
  - Can be added either in XML or programatically
- `SpectrumPreferenceCompat` for use with the preference support library
- `SpectrumPalette` for integrating a color selection view into any part of your app

## Deploying to Bintray
First, make sure the project's information is configured correctly in the `ext` block in `spectrum/build.gradle`. Next, put your Bintray information in your `local.properties` file; you will need to define `bintray.user`, `bintray.apikey`, and `bintray.gpg.password`.

To deploy the artifacts, run the following commands. The first is a dry run to make sure the artifacts can be built correctly. The second actually deploys to Bintray.

```
./gradlew install
./gradlew bintray
```
